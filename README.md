Project on date-time and decision-making using python

The given program stimulates the altitude-cum distance scale of an aircraft during flight and landing of the aircraft.
It takes the input of altitude of the aircraft from the ground in feet and approximate distance of the aircraft from the destination in nautical miles.
These parameters are then calculated and converted into km unit.

In this program, one if and else and 28 elif statements which is dedicated to specific altitude of the aircraft and the distance of the aircraft from the destination.
The program has date and time settings to display the current date and time.
It also has two break statements to quit the program from running and a calculator at the end to calculate the altitude and distance of the aircraft in kilometer.

The input operands are keyed in as floating-point numbers so that in later cases, we can use the data to calculate the altitude and distance in decimal numbers.
The 2 break statements are used simultaneously to quit the program.
To quit the program we need to enter ‘Q’ in the data input place(Please enter the altitude at which you want the plane to fly and Enter the distance from the destination) simultaneously to stop the program from running.

The program runs by printing the current time and date.
Then the program takes data about altitude and the distance of the aircraft.
This data is then processed within a series of elif statements.
When one of the elif loop conditions matches with the given input data, it prints the statement and then use the given input data to convert the given altitude and distance to kilometer unit.
