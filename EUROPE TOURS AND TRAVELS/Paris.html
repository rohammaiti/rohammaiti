Croissants may look simple, but these perfectly flaky pastries require time (we’re talking several days!) and a whole set of skills to perfect.\n'+
            'A great option is La Maison d’Isabelle (47ter Boulevard Saint-Germain), which recently received an award for Best Croissant in Paris.</li><li>Escargots, are presented in their shells and stuffed with a mouthwatering combination of garlic, herbs and butter.\n'+
            'However, escargots are now so popular that countless Paris restaurants have put their own creative spin on the dish. You’ll now find snails served with Roquefort, truffle, and even curry-based sauces, and so much more.\n'+
            ' L’Escargot Montorgueil is a true Parisian institution that has been serving snails for nearly 200 years. You can sample the traditional Burgundy variety, or spice things up and try the curry, foie gras, or truffle butter versions!</li>\n'+
            '<li> macarons are possibly the best thing that ever happened to French sweets. Their delicate and airy shells are made of almond flour, and filled with a rich, luscious interior.\n'+
            'Popular flavors include pistachio, chocolate, vanilla or raspberry, but don’t be scared to try some of the more unusual options: salted butter caramel, green tea, or rose petals, just to name a few.\n'+
            'Paris abounds with macaron specialty shops, most of them offering incredible quality. Pierre Hermé remains a clear favorite of ours for his creativity—and his Balinese dark chocolate macaron.</li>\n'+
            '<li>A great jambon-beurre is all about the quality of its only three ingredients: Parisian ham, butter and, of course, the deliciously crispy baguette that’s holding the magic together.\n'+
            'It is usually made up of crusty baguette, excellent French butter, and real Parisian ham. Made from carefully-selected ingredients, the jambon-beurre sandwich at La Fontaine de Belleville is famous throughout the city. You can opt to have it to go, or sit down at the terrace and enjoy it alongside a green salad.</li>\n'+
            '<li>Steak tartare is a bistro classic that consists of raw ground beef seasoned with capers, onion and black pepper. Traditionally, you’ll find it served with a raw egg yolk on top.  Le Severo is heaven for carnivores, so you can expect the meat quality to be absolutely top notch. Their amazingly tasty steak tartare comes with french fries or green beans.</li></ol></p>'
