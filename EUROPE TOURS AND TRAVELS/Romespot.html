    <h1 style="font-style: italic;"><u>Top  things to do in Rome</u></h1><br>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">While visiting Rome, some of the things that you must include in your tour plans are listed below-
        <ul style="list-style-type:square; font-size:20px;">
            <li>See Michaelangelo’s Last Judgement at the Vatican Museums. This labyrinth museum has over five miles of corridors and breathtaking art ranging from Ancient Egypt to contemporary paintings, with themes of divinity and spirituality running throughout.</li>
            <li> Climb the dome at St Peter’s Basilica.</li>
            <li>Take a tour bus and rome around the ciy. You will find a blend of old and new Rome city with rich history and it's local streets. You can also try their local food.</li>
            <li>See the macabre Capuchin Crypt and Roman catacombs. They are worth seeing as they are years old. Fast forward to today, and the maze of secret, underground tunnels — which doubled as a place of worship and a sacred burial ground with solid rock tombs — remain mostly intact.</li>
            <li>See the Sacred Steps at the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran.</li>
            <li>Ride the glass elevator to the Vittoriano. The monolithic marble ‘Altar of the Fatherland’ monument in Piazza Venezia hides the most spectacular vantage point of the Eternal City!</li>
            <li>Explore the eerie streets of Pompeii. Today you can walk the streets, go inside houses, and enter restaurants frozen in time 2,000 years ago on that fateful day!</li>
        </ul>

        <tr>
            <td>1.</td>
            <td>Colosseum-The building was begun by Vespasian in AD 72, and after his son Titus enlarged it by adding the fourth story, it was inaugurated in the year AD 80 with a series of splendid games. The Colosseum was large enough for theatrical performances, festivals, circuses, or games,<br>
                which the Imperial Court and high officials watched from the lowest level, aristocratic Roman families on the second, the populace on the third and fourth.</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2.</td>
            <td>The Pantheon - the best-preserved monument of Roman antiquity - is remarkably intact for its 2000 years. This is despite the fact that Pope Gregory III removed the gilded bronze roof tiles, and Pope Urban VIII ordered its bronze roof stripped and melted down to cast the canopy over<br>
                the altar in St. Peter's and cannons for Castel Sant'Angelo.</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3.</td>
            <td>Roman Forum-Walking through the forum, now in the middle of a throbbing modern city, is like stepping back two millennia into the heart of ancient Rome. Although what survives of this center of Roman life and government shows only a small fraction of its original splendor,<br>
                the standing and fallen columns, its triumphal arches, and remains of its walls still impress, especially when you consider that for centuries, the history of the Forum was the history of the Roman Empire and of the Western world.</td>
            <td><img srcset="r3.jpg" width="200" height="150"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4.</td>
            <td>Trevi Fountain-One of the city's most popular tourist attractions, this 17th-century masterpiece has been immortalized in films until it is almost a required visit. Throwing a coin (not three) into the Trevi Fountain (Fontana di Trevi) is a tradition that is supposed to assure your return to Rome.<br>
                Rome's largest fountain, Fontana di Trevi is supplied by an aqueduct originally constructed by Agrippa, the great art patron of the first century BC, to bring water to his baths. The fountain was created for Pope Clement XII between 1732 and 1751 by Nicolò Salvi,<br>
                and built against the rear wall of the palace of the Dukes of Poli.</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5.</td>
            <td>Vittorio Emanuele II Monument-It's ironic that this grandiose monument, considered one of the national symbols of Italy, is rarely admired by Romans, who liken it to a wedding cake or a giant typewriter. Like it or not, the vast neo-classical structure crowns Capitoline Hill, symbolic center of ancient Rome,<br>
                overlooking the later city across Piazza Venezia.</td>
            <td><img srcset="r5.jpg" width="200" height="150"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>6.</td>
            <td>Castel Sant'Angelo National Museum-Begun in AD 135 as a mausoleum for the Emperor Hadrian and his family, Castel Sant'Angelo is a massive drum-shaped structure overlooking the Tiber near the Vatican. Over the millennia of its existence, Castel Sant'Angelo has been used as a papal residence and a fortress,<br>
                and more recently as a National Museum.Visitors reach the castle across a pedestrian bridge lined with statues of angels (by Bernini), and ascend to its five floors on a spiral ramp. At its various levels are prison cells, a large collection of weapons. </td>
