This is a website project built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The website is based on travelling guide to some European cities. To run the website we need to execute the
Main.html file which serves as the homepage. From there we can navigate to various webpages of the websites. CSS is used to control the image size, background colours and all
while Javascript is used for handling some specific events inside the webpages like giving confirmation wether to go to new webpage or not, showing and changing text contents
of the webpage. Use of modern HTML and CSS can be found, except some cases where old HTML elements were used in the webpages.

How to run- Execute the Main.html file using a web browser. On running it, the homepage of the website will open. From there you acn select any cities that you want to
travel. The details are included there. Two buttons named as "About us" and "Guidlines" are incuded for the users to get website related details and a general details
for the tourists overall visting any place. Currently We have included information about London, Rome, Paris and Barcelona. More cities would be added later on with
enhanced features. You could get details like weather, beast time to visit, hotels, tourist spots etc. 

Biblography- The images were collected from google, the background colour combinations were taken from https://cssgradient.io/gradient-backgrounds/ . Information about
new HTML tags and attributes along with CSS were taken from W3 Schools and other relevant internet sites. To use Javascript to control events many resources were used
particularly, W3 Schools, GeeksForGeeks, Stack Overflow and other relevant websites. The details and information about the weather of various cities were collected from
Weather Spark. The details about location, touring spots and hotels were collected using Google and other relevant websites.
